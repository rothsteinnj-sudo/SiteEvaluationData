SETUP: Add Google Form URL to Dashboard
===============================================

I've added "View Raw" links to each evaluation so you can click through to the original Google Form response.

TO ACTIVATE:
1. Find your Google Form URL:
   - Open your form in Google Forms
   - Click "Send" button (top right)
   - Copy the URL from the "Link" section

2. Update app.py:
   - Open app.py with a text editor
   - Find line ~19 with: GOOGLE_FORM_URL = '...'
   - Replace with your actual form URL
   - Save the file

3. Restart the dashboard:
   - Press Ctrl+C in your terminal to stop the server
   - Run: bash start_web.sh

4. Refresh your browser - you'll now see "📋 View Raw" buttons on each score!
